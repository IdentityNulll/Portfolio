# 🌈 Prism Portfolio

A creative personal portfolio inspired by **light refraction through a prism**.  
The idea is simple: **one focused beam of light splits into multiple colorful rays**, each representing my skills, projects, and goals as a developer.

## ✨ Concept

This portfolio is based on the physics concept where white light passes through a triangular prism and splits into different colors.

In this project:
- The **background video** creates atmosphere and depth
- The **prism** represents focus and direction
- The **colored light rays** represent:
  - Skills
  - Projects
  - Learning journey
  - Future goals

Each ray will later act as an interactive section of the website.
